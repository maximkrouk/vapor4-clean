# Vapor4-clean

This is a template for Vapor 4 users that does the absolute minimum to set up a working Vapor 4 environment.

Unlike the official templates that are currently available, this template does not include vast swathes of extra example code that you will always need to delete. Instead, it adds just a single “hello” route so you can be sure everything is working correctly.

It’s my hope that the official Vapor project will add a template similar to this one at some point in the future, but until then please use this however you want.

## Try it out

If you have already installed the Vapor toolbox, you can create a new Vapor project from this repo using the following command:

```
vapor new MyProject --template=maximkrouk/vapor4-clean
```
